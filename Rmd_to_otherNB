How I convert Rmd files to ipynb notebooks which can be run in Jupyter notebooks with R kernel.

Need: 
python, and packages:
rpy2

R, and packages:
knitr

To know how to edit path in windows

What to do 

Open anaconda
go to pyandr environment and open a terminal

If you type notedown, this should open an help/usage file, if notedown has been installed
Then to convert your file, just use:
notedown "path\file.Rmd" > "path\file.ipynb"
if everything is installed correctly, this seems to work just fine (no switches etc required)

run this in a jupyter notebook - change kernel to R, and it should work...

Notes/what doesn't work:
Doesn't remove the yaml, so delete that
Code chunk/ cell names, don't seem to port?
